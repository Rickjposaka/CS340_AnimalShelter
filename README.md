## Module Eight Journal â€“ Reflection

### 1. How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I try to write clean and simple code by using clear function names and keeping things organized. In the CRUD module (animal_shelter.py), I used small functions so the code is easier to understand and reuse. This helps a lot when I need to use the same code in other projects with MongoDB.

### 2. How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
When I start a project, I break it into smaller steps like connecting to the database, filtering the data, and creating the dashboard. I think about the whole process before I begin coding. This time, I worked more carefully and planned more than usual, because the project felt more like a real-world task.

### 3. What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve real problems by building useful tools. In this case, the dashboard helps Grazioso Salvare work better with their data. It shows how technology can help organizations do their jobs faster and more effectively.
